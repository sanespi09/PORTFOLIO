# PORTFOLIO ðŸ§³

Personal portfolio page made with simple HTML, CSS, little bit of Bootstrap and Vanilla JavaScript.  
My focus was to really take a grasp on these baseline technologies without using any framework.

The result is a very simple, streamlined and **fast** website. Maybe in a future i'll port it into Next.js.
